CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:25 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libigl" with any
  of the following names:

    libiglConfig.cmake
    libigl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libigl" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libigl_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "libigl"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
